The first step is knowing how much you want to borrow. You should ask for enough to complete your project, including installation fees, taxes, and other expenses.
Should Be:
The first step is knowing how much you want to borrow. This is a very important step. You should ask for enough to complete your project, but remember that if you need to raise all of it: LendSquare campaigns are all-or-nothing. 
Remember to take into all expenses associated with your project. It’s
easy to forget about things like installation fees, sales tax, and
other expenses. How do I choose the amount to borrow?
** Now
Now that we know how much you want to borrow, you need to decide on the maximum interest rate and how long you want to take to pay back your loan
Should Be
Now, you need to decide two things:
1) The maximum interest rate (how are interest rates determined?)
2) How long you want to take to pay back your loan (how should I
   choose the length of my loan?)
** Loan Banner: "cost" -> "loan amount"
**  Is:
Taxpayer ID number. This can be an SSN, an EIN, or an ITIN.
T.I.N.
Should be:
Taxpayer ID number. This can be an SSN, an EIN, or an ITIN.
T.I.N. (Why do you need this?)
** Open new dwolla account button in new tab/window
** Pre Pledging Dash
wording instead of “congratulations your loan is in the “Pre Pledging” state”
change to: “Congratulations! Your loan has been approved. Your loan will be accessible to the public when you click on the button below. As soon as you click on that button, you will have two weeks to get enough pledges to fulfill your loan. We recommend you review how lendsquare loans work and How can I market my loan?
** Borrower dash during pledging: "Your campaign is live and people can pledge on it. 
There are currently X valid bids. Y% of your total has been pledged by
bidders who selected an interest lower than your maximum of Z%.  Your
campaign ends in x days, 5 hours, and z minutes."
** Your loan request for $5500 for Help us buy a truck is in the auction period awaiting admin confirmation.
Should be:
Congratulations! Your Help us buy a truck campaign had enough backers! Your backers are being reviewed by LendSquare. We are determining the exact amount and interest rate for your loan. You should receive an email when we’re done (this page will update too).
** "Bidder" --> "Backer" on borrower dashboard
* FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES
** Notification of invalid pledge on lender dash should not be displayed if there is a newer pledge of any stage
** Log users out after 5 minutes of inactivity
** Make "Request Approval" button larger once it is active
* CAN'T RECREATE
** "Loan in Funding Period: Big Bug": I looked in the admin database and Payment #58 is presumably correctly associated with Loan #84, in repayment stage, and not loan #179, which that bidder also bid on and which is still in pledging stage. I do not see a bug or a way to recreate a bug here; please advise!
** Bug starting "What I did: Made a lender account, then made a bid..." in "Lender Bug Testing"; creating a new lender and then making a bid does not produce errors for me. It looks like this bug report may be missing some key details needed to recreate the bug.
** Bug starting "After transferring funds through Dwolla...": I see a payment recorded for this pledge of $500 to "Five Blind Mice -- Exterminators!" but since I don't have this user's login I can't view their dashboard to see if there is a problem. If this user still doesn't see this payment recorded, could you send a login to their dashboard? Or otherwise, could you send more specific instructions on how to recreate this bug?
** Bug starting "Did not confirm original email" in Borrower Bug Testing does not have enough information to recreate.
* QUESTIONS
** You say "Outstanding" pledges should only be pledges that have not won, lost, or been funded -- this is a little unclear. A pledge may have won and not been funded, in which case it *should* be displayed here ("Waiting for you to transfer funds"), right? Please clarify.
** Emails to lenders: since lenders can create a bid without entering their name, how should emails that might get sent before the name is filled in get formatted?
** Collecting information in the loan application in a standardized way: if you have criteria for this, please send them. This was never confirmed after the last milestone.
** "contact - in bottom of the page should have hyperlink to the address for support" -- can you clarify this? 
** The comments under the heading "Borrower Agreement" in the document "Borrower Bug Testing" don't suggest any clear action items. Can you let us know what if anything needs to be changed here?
** "What is an “inactive bidder”? That text will need changing" -- please send new text.
** "On emails sent from borrowers to lenders: it shouldn’t have the borrower’s email in the “from” field, because then it is treated as spam." -- should these also be sent from donotreply@lendsquare.com? Should there be additional info appended to the body of the message to make the origin clear? Please send any changes/clarifications you need to make here.
** You mention that an email is not sent when a loan ends pledging: I don't have such an email in my list, but if you send

* EXPLANATIONS
** "Some lenders do not have names associated with them": VALID lenders with valid bids will always have names associated with them, but since we allow lenders to sign up with just an email and start bidding immediately, lenders without names who haven't finished the process may linger in the database.
** robots.txt -- not currently, but we can put up whatever you provide!
** If a lender sends too much money: if you return the overpayment manually, and then edit the payment record in the admin to the correct amount, everything should work smoothly.
** "Loans in auction or funding stage do not show up" on /loans, reported as a bug; per email of May 28th, the "blue" loans are supposed to be loans in repayment only. Let us know if that has changed.
** Bug beginning "What I did: I made a borrower account" on first page of borrower feedback was fixed during testing as a blocking bug; see email exchange from June 19th.
** List of notifications: this was requested earlier, and sent by email on March 25th. No changes were requested since then.
** "Screwed up" tasks menu displaying during loading: this is because Javascript that fires when the page is loaded is needed to compress the variable number of tasks that might be there into the appropriate amount of space
** Monthly payment calculater requested on edit loan page: this is already there and re-calculated every time the relevant fields are edited.
** "admin/applications" -- there's no such thing as "incomplete" applications here. They only get saved if they've entered a full, valid application.
