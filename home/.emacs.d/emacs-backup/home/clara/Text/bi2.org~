*** I discovered my bisexuality at age fifteen, when after a few substantial crushes on boys, I developed a substantial crush on a female friend. I spent the next couple years awkwardly coming out to some friends and family, desperately searching for representations of girls who liked girls, and being uncertain whether I still liked boys or whether that had been a phase and I was actually a lesbian. When I started college and met a boy I really liked, I became sure of what I'd suspected -- I'm definitely bisexual. As bisexual activist Robin Ochs says, “I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted – romantically and/or sexually – to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.”
*** privilege not to be out
** "Rounding"
*** I don't think the "bisexual" label is necessarily appropriate for everyone who has attractions to multiple genders. I know or know of plenty of people who admit attractions to multiple genders but "round down" or "round up" their personal identification to gay/lesbian or to straight, because they have a significant preference for one of the genders. Which is fine and great! (And, as I mentioned above, something I considered when first coming to terms with the queer aspects of myself.) And some people prefer not to label their sexuality at all -- which is a valid personal choice. 
** according to a 2002 study by the National Center for Health Statistics, a total of 4.6% of men and women between 18 and 44 identified as bisexual, compared to 3.6% of the same group who identified as gay

**** Dan Savage, the popular gay advice columnist who coined the term "Good, Giving, and Game" as a piece of sex advice and founded the "It Gets Better" campaign to support and encourage gay youth, has a long-standing habit of rebranding self-identified bisexuals as closet cases. “I meet someone who’s 19-years-old who tells me he’s bisexual and
I’m like, ‘Yeah, right, I doubt it. I tell them come back when you’re
like 29 and we’ll see,’” Dan says, as well as commenting, "there aren’t many bi guys who want or wind up in long-term, same-sex relationships — monogamous or not."
**** Hi Dan! I'm 28 and have been openly bi and completely monogamous for over ten years.

**** I recently watched the excellent Netflix original show Orange is the New Black, which almost immediately struck me as a fairly egregious example of bisexual erasure. In the first scene of the first episode of the first season, we see a flashback montage which includes the main character, Piper, kissing both a man and a woman. I immediately felt that unfortunately-oh-so-rare sense of recognition and identification -- this series was going to star a bi girl! Just like me!
**** But as the show went on, I found myself disappointed by the writers' portrayal of Piper's sexuality. Her friends and family are confused by her orientation, and wonder if she is gay or straight; but in the first season, despite several conversations about Piper's sexuality, the word "bisexual" is never uttered. It's like it doesn't exist.
***** cite: comments on whether she is gay or straight
**** The word does get mentioned briefly near the beginning of Season 2. "Or... bi, I guess?" says Piper's clueless ex-fiance. In a flashback, Piper is shown telling her best friend "I like hot girls... I like hot boys..." Sounds pretty bisexual to me! And the real-life Piper Kernan, on whom fictional Piper Chapman is based, asserts in an interview: "I'm bisexual, so I'm part of the gay community." Yet, the fictional Piper labels her own sexuality only as far as saying "It's a spectrum, like a Kinsey scale." Why did these writers -- working on a progressive and explicit show that features several lesbian characters, explores the experience of a transgender woman, portrays frequent sex and violence, and throws profanity around casually -- choose to avoid the word "Bisexual"?
*** Real Piper: "I'm bisexual, so I'm part of the gay community."
*** Fictional Piper: "I like hot girls... I like hot boys..."
*** NOBODY SAYS THE GODDAMND WORD
**** until that brief mention in season 2
** Gay characters
*** Besides Orange is the New Black, shows like Buffy, The Simpsons, 30 Rock, Mad Men, Veronica Mars, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother, and others [choosing among shows I've seen a substantial amount of and mostly liked, here] portray openly gay or lesbian characters. But neither any of these shows, nor the several others I enjoy that sadly fail to include openly gay or lesbian characters, identify any of their characters as explicitly bisexual.
*** (Well, there's one exception. In the very last episode of 30 Rock, aired in 2013, perennial butt-of-the-joke Lutz reveals that he identifies as bisexual -- by asserting that "dumb, old, uncool, part-Inuit, bisexual, 51-year-old Lutz" was ready to get back at his co-workers for their years of disrespectful pranks and jokes. Which, sadly enough, felt like a major triumph to me: someone said "bisexual" on a popular network TV show!!)
