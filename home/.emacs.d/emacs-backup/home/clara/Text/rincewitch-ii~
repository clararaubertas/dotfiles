There are a lot of things they don't tell you about being a witch.

For one thing, that whole maiden/mother/crone thing is misrepresented. Most witches are sexually active but don't have  families. I'd considered witchcraft as a teenager, but once I gave up my maidenhood to a girl I met at school, I assumed I was disqualified. It turned out that wasn't true. Ms. Stone only contacted me after I'd assumed I was way too old to be chosen and was already spending my nights stoned and naked and uncertain.

And you can't be angry when you try to do anything. That's the hardest part. If you're even kind of angry, physically at least, your magic is too unpredictable. I heard a story about one girl who ... well, let's say she had to pay for her ex-boyfriend's facial reconstruction. And she'd only meant to cast a little glamour on herself. I've pushed the envelope a bit, of course; I tried using magic to clear out a little traffic one day when I'd just gotten a lot of awkward questions from my mother and was late meeting some friends. And, well, that was a while ago and I still have traffic school every week for a while if I want even a chance at keeping my license.

So, it turns out, most of witchcraft is the things you do to stay calm. A lot of gals do drugs; weed is pretty popular, and of course alcohol has a contingent. I dabble in those but find they don't keep my anger down reliably enough. The only thing I've found that works for me is vigorous exercise. I run five miles a day and lift weights three times a week. If I miss even one session, I can't do magic for a day. The anger pops up. It's hard to keep up with, but it's worth it for the power.

Other pedestrians swerve unconsciously around me as I run; I let the sweet calm run through me as I let my power out, slowly. I am too tired to be angry, and that means I can do anything.
