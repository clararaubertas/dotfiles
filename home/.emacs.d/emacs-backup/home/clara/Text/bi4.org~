Nobody Says the "B" Word
Some Notes on Bisexual Erasure

At age fifteen, I developed a consuming crush on a friend; not
uncommon. But I was surprised by the fact that my crush was female. I
didn't know any other girls who liked girls (that I knew of --
Facebook now tells me that was far from true!), but I was desperate to
see those feelings reified in story, and to learn more about what it
might mean for me to be lesbian or bisexual. 

So, I looked up "lesbians" in the card catalog at one of the local
libraries (specifically choosing the library that still actively used
a physical card catalog, since I was too shy to be seen typing
"lesbians" into a library computer!). There wasn't much, but I
devoured what queer representation I could. In the excellent story "Am
I Blue" by Bruce Coville that opens the queer-themed young adult
fiction anthology of the same name, everyone in the world is
temporarily turned a shade of blue corresponding to their "degree of
gayness". Some people are bright blue, some people aren't blue at all,
and some people are in-between -- like our protagonist, who has been
questioning his sexuality after being taunted with homophobic slurs.
He concludes the story looking forward to someday meeting "the girl of
my dreams... or Prince Charming. Whichever." As a teenager, I was
"charmed" by this tale and its message of cameraderie and support for
what I read as a bisexual young man -- but in fact, the story never
uses the word "bisexual", only the terminology of "degrees" of
"gayness" and "blueness". I found an even closer parallel to my own
experience in "Empress of the World" by Sara Ryan, which describes a
teenage girl who discovers her bisexuality when she falls for her best
friend at summer camp -- which was exactly what had just happened to
me. With representation of my bisexuality rare and precious, I clung
tightly to this touchstone of identification -- even though the main
character's friends dismiss bisexuality as a phase on the way to
lesbianism.

At summer camp and at college, I met other people who identified as
bisexual, but still saw few if any characters or public figures
referred to as bisexual. When I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I
felt a strong identification with Willow, who obviously (it seemed to
me) shared my attraction to both men and women. Her relationship with
Oz and her relationship with Tara both looked sincere and sensual. I
thought of Willow as a bisexual woman, until in a later season, she
refers to herself as "gay now". What? But she's bi!, I thought. Since
then I've heard interpretations of Buffy that make this make more
sense to me, like the show's themes of permanent identity changes and
growing up; and of course, Willow's romantic and sexual history follow
a path that has been taken by many women who later identify
exclusively as lesbian. Still, I was disappointed that I hadn't, as
I'd thought, found another bisexual girl on TV.

As I started watching more TV shows after a TV-free childhood, I still
didn't see bisexuals. Among the TV shows I've watched, several have
canonically gay or lesbian characters -- The Simpsons, 30 Rock, Mad
Men, Veronica Mars, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Modern Family, How I
Met Your Mother . But I can't think of a single character from the
shows I've watched -- even a minor or one-episode character -- who is
described in the show as bisexual. (Well, there's one exception. In
the very last episode of 30 Rock, aired in 2013, perennial
butt-of-the-joke Lutz reveals that he identifies as bisexual -- by
asserting that "dumb, old, uncool, part-Inuit, bisexual, 51-year-old
Lutz" was ready to get back at his co-workers for their years of
disrespectful pranks and jokes. Which, sadly enough, felt like a major
triumph to me: someone said "bisexual" on a popular network TV show!!
And a character in Community calls that show's Dean Pelton a
"pansexual imp", but that's supposed to be an insult.) While I'm all
for more TV characters who are gay or lesbian or have an unlabelled
sexuality, I'm still frustrated that bisexuality has this
visibility problem that goes even beyond the general visibility
problem of queer characters of any kind.

A few years ago, I posted "Clara is bisexual" to my Facebook status in
honor of National Coming Out Day. A relative later emailed me asking
if this meant I was involved with a woman in addition to my boyfriend
-- a question that to me, sounded as absurd as thinking my boyfriend
might have a tall blonde on the side because he likes Uma Thurman!
Popular gay advice columnist Dan Savage dismissed bisexuality by
saying, "I meet someone who’s 19-years-old who tells me he’s bisexual and
I’m like, ‘Yeah, right, I doubt it. I tell them come back when you’re
like 29 and we’ll see.’" Larry King thought Anna
Paquin should be referred to as "formerly bisexual" rather than
currently because she is married to a man. Even my favorite author,
Lois McMaster Bujold, has a character correct someone on her husband's
orientation by saying "was bisexual. Now he's monogamous." As though
one couldn't possibly be both! 

The public perception of bisexuality is rife with such confusions and
misinterpretations. Bisexuals are seen as undecided, confused, greedy,
promiscuous, polyamorous, unfaithful -- of course some are, but no
more than gays or straights! (See the #bi erasure or #bi invisibility
tags on Tumblr if you'd like more examples of the identity-undermining
things bisexuals hear!) I don't think it's a coincidence that the word
"bisexual" conjures up these inaccurate implications for so many, and
that the word "bisexual" is also so vanishingly rarely uttered in
popular media. 

As I recently watched the first scene of the brilliant new show Orange
is the New Black, I felt a similar feeling of recognition to that I'd
had years earlier with Willow. The main character, Piper, is shown in
a flashback montage, kissing a man and kissing a woman in parallel
shots that follow each other immediately. I thought: Piper is a
bisexual woman, just like me! Later in the show, it seems that Piper
prefers not to label her sexuality -- she says she's "on a spectrum,
like a Kinsey scale" -- something I hadn't thought of. But there is a
hole where the word "bisexuality" could appear in the conversations
that Piper's friends have about her orientation. They act confused as
to whether she's "lesbian" or "straight now" or "gay again", all
without ever considering bisexuality as an option.
The fact that this show doesn't even use the word "bisexual" when
characters are rudely speculating about a woman who has relationships
with multiple genders is a glaring symptom of the invisibility of this label.


Orange is the New Black is a great show, well-written, unafraid to be
provocative, and with wonderful and unusual diversity (women of a
variety of races, lesbian women, butches, femmes, straight women, "gay
for the stay" women, a trans woman). But for me, the show skips a beat
when it has Piper and Piper's friends discuss her sexuality without
ever mentioning the word "bisexual". (The only time the word is used
on the show is when Piper's fiance, after throwing out lesbianness and
straightness as options for Piper's identity, tacks on hesitantly:
"Or... bi, I guess?") The dialogue of these scenes about Piper's
sexuality feels stilted and constrained, as though the writers or
characters are deliberately avoiding a potentially relevant word. I
don't literally think that someone involved with the show said "don't
use the word bisexual" -- 
Piper Kernan, the real-life woman whose book
about her prison experience inspired the creation of the fictional
Piper Chapman, called herself "bisexual" when interviewed in [year].

Of course, using "bisexual" as an umbrella term doesn't convey the
subtleties of all the "shades of blue", or the other complex axes and
angles of human sexuality. 

the social context in which people *will* be described as gay or
straight, or mayyyybe bi. And I would like this to be converted to a
social context in which people will be described as gay, straight, or
bi; that would still be problematic, since those labels don't cover
everyone, but I think using the oversimplifying trichotomy would free
a lot of people like me from the particularly grating inaccuracy of
the dichotomy. I'm talking about trichotomy over dichotomy for casual
lumping, because casual lumping happens at a scale where we just can't
have more than a handful of options. I am all for more subtle
gradations in individual identification and when discussing
orientations in contexts that allow for more details.

I have one foot in the straight world
and one foot in the queer world; I had to awkwardly come out to
friends and family as a teen, but I also got to have a big straight
wedding with no social push-back. In the words of bisexual activist
Robin Ochs, "I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have
in myself the potential to be attracted – romantically and/or sexually
– to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the
same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the
same degree." Bisexuals are everywhere, but we remain invisible as
long as our label is underused.

Bisexual invisibility is a self-perpetuating pattern. Many people are
hesitant to identify with a label that's so rarely represented and
frequently misinterpreted... which means it looks like there are no
bisexuals... which means people don't create bisexual characters...
which makes people reluctant to identify... you get the picture. Only
more bisexuals in media can save us from this spiral!
