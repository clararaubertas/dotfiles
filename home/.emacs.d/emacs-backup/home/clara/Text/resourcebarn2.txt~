RESOURCE BARN
An Educational Fantasy

Everything around me was unfamiliar. After my nearly 50-year nap -- well, cryogenic freezing is more technically accurate, but 50-year nap is how it felt -- a lot had changed in the world. I'd gotten a little debriefing at the defrosting center, but they wanted to let me walk around outside as soon as possible and start to get acclimated to my new era. So here I was, standing on the street of the future -- now my present -- wondering what exactly I should do next. 
My eye was caught by a large, white building, with "RESOURCE BARN #1729" printed above the door in large, friendly letters; this seemed as good a place as any to begin my explorations! The first thing I saw on entering was a large wall full of glowing text, occasionally changing. "Touch here to see a MAP"; "New! 2051 Edition Official Government-Endorsed Literature Syllabus"; "Volunteers for Hamlet tech crew meet in the theater at 3pm on Thursday"; "Browse Syllabi"; "Browse Schedule"; "Lost and Found List!". Facing this wall was a reception desk, with a friendly-looking woman staffing a computer. "Can I help you find anything?" she asked me.
"I'm, uh, new here." I explained. "I'm just trying to explore. So, what *is* a Resource Barn?"
"Wow, you really must be new," she said, and then got a closer look at my clothes -- not my outdated 2014 clothes, but an almost aggressively bland set issued by the defrosting center. "Oh! Are you a defroster?"
"Yes," I said, a bit embarrassed. "2014. I'm just trying to get my bearings, here."
"Well, you've come to a good place for that! If I recall my history correctly, your time had a system of public schools with non-flexible all-day coursework."
I nodded, thinking of many childhood hours spent sitting at a desk staring at the clock and wishing for the school day to end.
"So, the Resource Barn system is what we use now instead. I can't even imagine making children sit still for hours a day, or forcing all kids to study the same material in the same way!"
"Why is it called Resource Barn?" I asked.
"It functions as a community hub for all kinds of learning resources," the receptionist explained. "Similar to the way libraries used to work before digital books; we have books, of course, but students can usually just pull up the titles they want on their pads, so if they just want something to read they don't need to come in. The most important resources are people -- teachers and counselors, other students -- but of course there's physical resources too, like the theater, the gym, the art room, the musical instruments, the labs."
Before I could ask another question, a young boy with a backpack walked in and started shyly poking at the interactive information wall. "Can I help you find anything?" the receptionist asked again.
"Um, I... I'm new. I wanted to... play basketball?"
"Of course! Pablo is around, I think -- he's one of the counselors. He loves basketball! Let me see if I can get him." She made a few swipes on her computer, then turned back to me: "Actually, you should probably talk to an intake counselor too, if you want to learn more about the Barn! We don't often get adults who aren't familiar with the system, but the intake counselors are great. Let me get Monica." A few more swipes. The new boy walked shyly away after the tall, friendly man that came to get him, and a smiling young woman walked out to greet me.
"A defrostee! Neat!" she exclaimed. "Oh, and I see Kev came in. I heard someone was out checking in on him and found out he liked basketball. Now, do you know what you would like to see first?"
"Well, not really! I'm new to all of this and just kind of want to look around."
"OK, great! I'll just show you around some of the rooms, then, and let me know if anything strikes you or if you have questions." She led me down a wide hallway, past several screens rotating displays of what looked like children's projects and more scheduling notices, and paused in front of a closed door with a window in it. "That's our chem lab," she explained. I peered into the window and saw a group of teenagers sitting at lab benches working. She added, "Jana over there at the back bench is one of our best chemistry students -- she comes in just for the advanced chem class in the afternoon, and spends the mornings working at her dad's place."
"Oh, so -- students can be part-time? Don't they have to, like, take English classes and stuff?"
"No, they don't have to! Everyone just signs up on a class-by-class basis, and of course usually spends time in the resource rooms for their projects or leagues or whatever. But there's no requirement that you take any particular number of credit-hours or anything."
"So, wait. What if someone just doesn't want to go to school?"
"They don't have to! Most kids come in at least for some group activities though, and more of them than not come for several classes. We keep records, and on average our sixteen-year-olds have taken enough coursework that they could pass what would have been the GRE in your time. There's no reason for most people to drop out of school altogether, since they're usually interested in something at the barn and they're not forced to participate in anything they don't like; and once you're at the barn, it's easy enough to pick up another class or two."
"Do you have anything like a GRE? How do you know who's taken enough classes?"
"Well, enough for what? Students take different groups of classes depending on their interests and abilities. You probably saw on the board when you came in that there are recommended curriculum lists. Like, we have the government's 'basic education groups' recommendation, which most people take at least several classes from; and others that are put out by individuals or by respected brands, like, Jana in the chem class is working through the pre-pharma curriculum that Merck published, so she'll probably be qualified to work at a place like that in a few years when she finishes her curriculum and takes a specialization course."
"What about college?"
"There are still a few of the old universities from your day around, so that's an option. But most people end up doing some privately-sponsored professional coursework or learning on the job instead -- and a lot also keep going to the barn, some well into adulthood, to continue their liberal arts education, because of course it's not a huge financial strain like a bachelor's degree was in your day."
"Hmm. That seems neat... although I do wonder if that's enough to get students a shared background of knowledge," I mused.
"I can see that! But the grade schools in your day taught such limited material, and so many of the students were so bored they weren't getting anything out of it. With students taking what they're interested in, and with all the individual attention from the counselors encouraging them to take recommended curricula, we end up with most students having a pretty broad background by the time they're adults."
"What if someone's parents don't want them to go to school -- like religious fundamentalists or something? Or do you not have that kind of thing anymore?"
"Oh, fundamentalism is still around. Actually Kev, the boy you saw come in at the desk, is someone with fundamentalist parents, who's just registered for the first time. We have government listings of everyone in the country, of course, so we know when a child has never showed up for school. So every year any family with a child between 6 and 15 who hasn't been to a barn at all in the past year gets a home visit."
"And you make them go to school?"
"Oh, no, of course not! A social worker speaks to the child and the parents, and tries to get the child alone to see if the *kid* wants to go to the barn. Usually they do, because of something they've heard from their friends, and the issue is something with their parents. That's what happened with Kev -- his parents are religious and they said they'd like to keep him at home, but when the social worker talked to him by himself he said he wanted to play basketball. So the worker hooked him up with the schedules for the barn jitneys and he came in on his own."
"Isn't that kind of weird, pitting a kid against their parents like that?"
"If a kid and their parents are all happy not doing any visits to the barn, that's fine, but if a kid wants to do something at the barn and their parents try to stop them, that's legally considered abuse. And we give the kids and parents information on the jitneys and the education stamps, of course -- some families are confused and think they can't put their kid in school if they don't have money or a means of transport. Which isn't true, of course!"
"Education stamps? Do you charge for the school or the classes? I thought this was all free!"
"Well, sort of. The infrastructure is all paid for through government funding -- the building itself, me & the other counselors, Megan who you met at the front and the other admins, the theater and the art and sports rooms and the musical equipment, the techs and the cafeteria and cleaning people. A lot of students have workjobs, actually, where they get paid to help out with some of the basic infrastructure stuff -- some of them are just basic jobs like working the machines in the cafeteria, and some of them have a training aspect too, like in the tech department, where a lot of the student workers learn programming and system administration and go on to work in those fields. And then we're required to have classes for all levels up to your high school equivalent in all the government's basic education groups -- science, math, literature, writing, history, geography -- so those are paid by the government too. Most of them are local teachers who are sort of freelancers and collect government paychecks for their students, and then when there isn't someone local available, like for our early American history course, the government will transfer someone in."
"So wait -- do students pay for the courses or don't they?"
"Every teacher gets to set their own price for their course; if they're teaching something from the basic education groups or a handful of other areas considered 'recommended', like music and sports, there's a cap on what the cost can be, and the teacher gets the use of the barn for free. If it's something less essential, the teacher has to pay a fee for their barn use; like for example, we had a guy teaching a lockpicking class last fall, which obviously isn't in the basic education groups, but there were several interested students signing up and paying, so he covered his costs."
"So students pay for all their extra classes with 'education stamps'?"
"Well, not exactly. You can pay for your courses with either cash or education stamps. Everyone gets issued enough baseline stamps to take the entire government-recommended curriculum from the basic education groups, plus a couple other courses. And stuff like the sports leagues and music groups are free to join. If your family is low-income, you get extra stamps, and if not, you can pay in cash for extra courses. We almost never see anyone having trouble paying for what they want to take -- once in a while there's a really ambitious kid who basically wants to pack an 80-hour work-week with high-cost classes, but even then they can usually get a workjob doing something they're interested in to cover whatever their stamps or their parents can't."
"Hang on. So just anyone can teach a class? What if they're teaching something really weird or stupid?"
"That depends on demand. It doesn't happen that much in this area, but I've heard of more rural barns having people teach young-earth creationism and stuff like that. Of course, the government doesn't include any religiously-biased classes on its recommendation lists -- that would violate the separation of church and state! -- so those classes have to pay to use the barn. So they lose money if no one wants to take the class, which is why we haven't seen it here, but we do see some of the more rural kids taking that stuff, usually because their parents make them."
"Don't you worry about indoctrinating people with inaccurate information like that?"
"Well, that's the thing -- almost nobody comes to a barn for just one class, and even if they do, they have a counselor working with them too. Most people, even if they come to a barn just to take something from their parents' perspective like that, they end up making friends and joining groups and taking other courses. So they get to talk to a lot of people with different perspectives. It's way better than having fundamentalist parents just pull their kids out of school altogether and isolate them from any exposure to new ideas, which used to happen a lot more."
I nod ruefully. "Yeah, there were a lot of debates in my time about home schooling regulations, because of stuff like that."
"Right -- we deal with that by making the barn an appealing place, and by checking in on kids like Kev to figure out what's going to make them come to the barn. Once a kid wants to come to the barn, their parents can't legally stop them, and 'If they come, we can teach them!', as some of us like to say. The counselors have a big role in that."
"How so?"
"It's one of the most carefully screened positions. All the counselors are people who have great skills at talking to nervous people and identifying interests, and they'll often get pretty deep relationships with some of the students. They try to be really proactive at getting the students they talk to into as many classes and activities as they'll be interested in. The intake counselors -- like me -- talk to people when they first come in, or anyone who's just wandering around. Sometimes we establish relationships with the students ourselves, if it's a good match, or sometimes we do referrals -- sending them to another counselor who specializes in academics or athletics, or even referring them to medical or psychological help if it looks like that would be appropriate."
