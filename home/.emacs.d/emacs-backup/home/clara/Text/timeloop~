Working title: "Time Loop in the Alley"
[but we'll definitely actually call it something cooler]
a Hyde Park horror story
a film by Clara, Mame, and friends
shot on location at MALKASPACE and environs over winter 2014-2015

A group of friends living in a Hyde Park apartment notice some strange
activity in their back alley while they're hiding out from a winter
snowstorm. People who enter the alley don't seem to be able to leave
-- our friends stand on their porch smoking cigarettes as they watch
strangers (and/or maybe their friends/neighbors/guests) do weird
things, trying to build fires out of their school notes, panicking in
place, paradoxically undresssing as they succumb to hypothermia,
eventually simply dying of cold. A couple of our characters try to go
down the three flights of wooden, snow-covered stairs and down into
the alley to help or investigate, but they can't return to the house.
Horrified and unable to help, our remaining friends watch them get
caught in the same mysterious force in the alley and endure a slow,
creepy demise. The remaining people realize that something is really
wrong with their alley and start working on a plan to try to address
it or at least save as many people as they can. They try to
communicate with their acquaintance who lives on the other side of the
alley.

* how will this end? a "final girl" or "final boy" escaping the still-generally-deadly alley? everyone just totally dead? the time loop defeated somehow?
* exact nature of the time loop TBD, but it should have some pretty identifiable/consistent rules at some level
* maybe it can have some kind of creepy origin in some evil deed?
* we'll have to figure out how internet/phone/text is affected by this. hopefully we can think of something cooler than this but in a pinch our characters can just be cut off by a power outage!
* you think that scene that was filmed half in three feet of snow and half in a wet puddle is a "continuity error" caused by multiple days of filming in the totally unpredictable Chicago winter? wrong! it's an artifact of the time loop! whatever the time loop rules are will allow this weird stuff to happen.
* dogs will eat a frozen corpse. because that's really creepy and would also be really fun to stage.
* creepy snow, freezing, snowboundness a la The Shining
* back-porch voyeurism a la Rear Window
* budget and location constraints leveraged for max creepy a la Night of the Living Dead
* maybe black-and-white? or maybe some cool color symbolism (e.g. color-coded hoodies/outerwear for different characters)?
