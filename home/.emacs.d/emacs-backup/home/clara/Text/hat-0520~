    Create a new class of Admnistrators on HelpAroundTown. These would have
        What we now call parent privileges: every time one of their children applies to a job, they got notified by email, same as parents now
        Admin privileges: so they can see all the children in their group. They can see everything a kid applied to, all the messages exchanged, ratings received and given.
--------- is this the same as: admin's view but with limits on the users you can see?

    Create a new pin symbol for the map, of a different color, to highlight those kids. Every kid has his pin. We activate the link to the profile. (now links are off).
--------- what map view where? what user view?

        While at it, also create a feature so every user can decide to activate his profile on the map. We will charge for that. Activate at payment. I need to be able to activate free for certain people.
-------------- 10 hours

    Create a contact Me feature for managing users’ contact info. Users can choose whether they want to be contacted by email, phone, SMS, Facebook.  We make the contact. [[Note sure: Users can also decide which contact info they want to make public, if any.]]
        This Contact me feature would be seen from User profiles and from ads.

What would it take to make the site HTTPS ????
-------- 2 hours + she needs to have certificate for $200

What would it take to make HelpAroundTown Town-based.
URL structure would be HelpAroundTown/[lexington](whatever relevant town)/…whatever it is now
Home page would have map centered on town, jobs from that town prioritized by date, ads from that town
Jobs page would prioritize jobs from that town (then categories and dates and existing structure)
Bulletin Board would present ads from that town on out, closest then most distant.
-------------------- 15 hours??

Also some Admin changes:
- show STATE, not just town in user listings (I just had someone sign up in AK, and the only reason I know is they are a minor and I got an email request for parental approval)
------- < 1 hour
- Do an Admin jobs report, with data for each job on:
who posted it, date, location, category, number of applicants, nb hired?, rating by buyer? rating by service provider?
------- downloadable or viewable?
we would also need to track time between job posting and first applicant
price (payment). This might be a bit tricky, given all the options.
----- currently no payment set up for *jobs* (only for "cards")
