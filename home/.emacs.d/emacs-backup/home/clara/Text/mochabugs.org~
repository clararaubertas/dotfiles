: that was the case with me (in Chrome) -- I had it set to not allow location tracking, not even to ask first, just to deny.  since the whole point of the app relies on knowing your location, it should probably display a message on the main screen if it can't get location info.  also it probably shouldn't let you submit an order with the "when I get there" option.

: 
: Our original code didn't include the concept of Categories, but the HTML you sent us did.  So for now we put all of the drinks in the first category; all the other displayed categories are dummies with dummy drinks.  Would you like us to implement the ability to categorize drinks, or leave this as-is for now and only use the first category in demos?
: 
: I would actually prefer categories, but if that substantially changes the data structure then that's not important. It is somewhat important to have the drinks display in different categories so they we can make them more manageable, even for the test users.

: this takes you directly to the cart with the order in the cart and the "send order" buttons ready -- but there is NO indication that you are re-ordering it; confused users will click their old order, then submit a second order because they think the first one just didn't go through.
: 
: the previous order should probably say something to indicate that clicking on it creates a NEW order, rather than just showing you the status of the old order (which I think would be the more intuitive result)
