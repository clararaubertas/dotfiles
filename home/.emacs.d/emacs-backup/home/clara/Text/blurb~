Parallactic develops flexible databases to handle all kinds of
collections of data, specializing in custom surveys and digitized
collections for museums and academic institutions. We worked with the
Adler Planetarium to create digitized, searchable, web-accessible
versions of their Herschel Correspondence Database, Webster Signatures
Database, and Dioptrice Telescope Database. With the University of
Chicago Graduate School of Business, we developed several flexible
survey tools for collecting social science data. Just a few of the
things we can do:
* databases viewable on the web by the public
* "members-only" sections or records visible only to project administrators
* records searchable by text or other fields, including complex searches combining year ranges, tags, etc.
* attractively displayed images
* optimization for mobile (phone/tablet) viewing
* optimization for accessibility
* ability to accept correctional suggestions from users and easily apply or discard them
* flexible surveys that direct users based on previous responses
* survey responses collected and displayed in custom ways for administrators
* browseable online catalogs or virtual exhibits
