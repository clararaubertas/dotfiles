* YEAR OF REGRESSION:
** The Moomers community has been using the New Years party to set collective intentions for our years! 2012 was the YEAR OF FEAR (as featured in the first issue of the Moomers Journal); 2013 was the YEAR OF MOLTING; and 2014 is the YEAR OF REGRESSION. Use and interpret as you see fit!
* Submission guidelines:
** Submissions are on a rolling basis. The Moomers Journal doesn't operate on a "time" or "calendar" based schedule, but rather comes out when we have received enough material for an issue. So please send in your pieces or pitches ASAP to keep the issues coming!
** Some of the themes we're considering for 2014 include MAPS, ARCHIVES, SEX, and SCHOOL -- so we'd particularly appreciate getting pieces on these themes!
** journal.moomers.org now exists; it has our contact info, and PayPal/bitcoin/dogecoin donation links.  
** If you did not receive Moomers Journal Issue 5 in December -- we probably do not have your correct address. Please let us know!
