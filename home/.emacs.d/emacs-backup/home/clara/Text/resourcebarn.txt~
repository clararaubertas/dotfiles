resourcebarn: an educational fantasy

* ENTER BARN.
** Manipulable list of schedules and notices on wall
** Signs pointing to various areas
** A friendly-looking waiting area, with a receptionist who will orient you if they don't recognize you or if you look confused

* DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL?
** No! No one has to.
** But there are serieses of classes offered through RB that get you respected credentials in the capitalist world
** Or into college (<- ???)
*** fewer people go to college in this universe since it's not what you need to get you ito the middle class
*** but does that mean the private university system continues as is?
*** will the government pay for your college?
*** is this all just left a vague cloud?
** If a child ages 6-15(ish?) is known to exist and has never checked in at a RB, a social worker goes to their house
**** SW tries to persuade kid to go to RB
****** makes sure they know about education stamps
****** makes sure they know about transit to the nearest barn
******* some kind of rule that government provides you some kind of free transport to the barn and it takes less than an hour
******* jitneys & stuff.
**** But the social worker cannot MAKE them go to school!
**** They can report/take action on the parents if the parents seem to be preventing a kid who wants to go to RB from going
**** But if both parent & kid are happy sans barn, cool
** Going to RB doesn't necessarily mean going to "school". You can take any courseload you want and have a part*time schedule.
*** you don't even have to take any courses. you can just do activities

* WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES?
** Well, it's sort of like a library, except the books are digital
** Resources include sports facilities, lab equipment, musical instruments, a theater space, etc...
**** Various barns might be known for having particularly good ones of one of these & might attract people from afar
** Art supplies, etc.
** Counselors!!!
** Teachers/classes

* HOW IS IT FUNDED?
** The main system is system of classes
** The government has a recommended curriculum and funds teachers for all the classes in that curriculum at every barn
** there are also curricula endorsed by any random organization; having worked through curricula endorsed by reputable brand-names (e.g. harvard, google) looks good on your resume/college app
** Private teachers can offer any class in the barn using the barn's resources
*** subject to certain caveats on appropriateness of the class, maybe?
*** they can set their price at anything from 0 to ???
*** maybe the class would be cancelled if there wasn't enough enrollment?
*** maybe they have to pay to use RB if their class is for*profit? like a percentage?
**** a procedure is needed for allocating resource spaces if there is high demand
** Using the rec spaces & the resources on your own time (if they're not booked for something) & joining the sports leagues, etc. are free 
*** funded by taxpayer dollars! in fantasy land the government is super rich
** If you're low*income the government sends you "education stamps" that are applicable to any course offered thru RB

* COUNSELORS
** Are great.
** An intake counselor talks to you when you first come in (if you want) or finds you wandering around
*** These peeps are selected for having great skills at talking to nervous people and identifying interests
*** Society-of-the-tower-like, they try to match people to where their interest will be most engaged
** Intake counselor can then recommend you to some of the other counseling staff, like athletic counselor, academic counselor, or even psychological or medical help
*** (obviously there is great single-payer health coverage available to all in fantasy land)

* Counselors, teachers, & staff are hired by some kind of administrative body.
** Part-time low-level staff jobs available for education stamp credit or for $!
** Students can be on straight workjobs like kitchen or cleaning staff, or on more intern-/training- type things like electrical maintenance, tech support, etc.
