On the Home page:
- ads are being shown as cut off at the bottom of the text (also on the Bulletin Board pages)
- ad graphics are not showing (also on the Bulletin Board pages)
- the map needs to be zoomed out some more. At least one level more, maybe 2. 
- Can you also try showing users on that map, not just jobs?
- the box with numbers of users and jobs posted needs to be made less high. Social icons should be just the right size to fill the less deep box. Base the depth on fitting in the users & jobs numbers at their current size, please.
- Tell a Friend box needs to be brought up to fill the empty space we have created. Keep the same distance as between user numbers box above and jobs listings above it.
- The Tell a Friend box could also be less high (decrease the HEIGHT of the box, width should be consistent with above)
- 'Learn about our safety precautions' should move to the RIGHT of these grey boxes, to fill the space there
- How to videos looks a lot better, thank you. This is the exact link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTH660zZPAKDmlqWIbYYNH2-Wda1Bk4DG

- Thanks for moving up the testimonials box. Works well.
- Here is the Boston Globe icon which I downloaded:
