Dear McKey and Poague,

We'd like to register a few issues with our rental unit, 5324 S.
Kimbark #3S, that need to be repaired.

1. Heat:
As of 10/18, the radiators in our unit are still not on, and the
temperature in the unit is 55 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Dining room windows:
The middle window in the dining room does not fully close, and has
substantial gaps between the windowpanes and the wooden window frames
that aren't sealed and are letting in cold air. This issue is a
contributing factor to the apartment being too cold.

3. Front door:
The knob on the front door of our unit does not turn from the inside;
this means that if the door is locked or fully closed, it cannot be
opened from the inside, so we have to choose between the inconvenience
& security hazard of leaving this door ajar or the inconvenience &
fire hazard of being unable to exit our unit via that door.

4. Bathroom windowsill:
Part of the wooden windowsill in the bathroom shower has broken off
due to wetness. This isn't a major issue affecting our enjoyment of
the unit but it is probably something you'd like to be aware of and
have the chance to fix before it gets worse.

Please contact us at clara.raubertas@gmail.com or at
617-308-1689 to arrange a time for workers to enter the unit and
address these issues.

Thanks!
Clara Raubertas
