resourcebarn: an educational fantasy

- ENTER BARN.
-- Manipulable list of schedules and notices on wall
-- Signs pointing to various areas
-- A friendly-looking waiting area, with 

- DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL?
-- No! No one has to.
-- But there are serieses of classes offered through RB that get you respected credentials in the capitalist world
-- Or into college (<- ???)
-- If a child ages 6-15(ish?) is known to exist and has never checked in at a RB, a social worker goes to their house
---- SW tries to persuade kid to go to RB
---- -- education stamps!
---- But the social worker cannot MAKE them go to school!
---- They can report/take action on the parents if the parents seem to be preventing a kid who wants to go to RB from going
---- But if both parent & kid are happy sans barn, cool
-- Going to RB doesn't necessarily mean going to "school". You can take any courseload you want and have a part-time schedule.

- WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES?
-- Well, it's sort of like a library, except the books are digital
-- Resources include sports facilities, lab equipment, musical instruments, a theater space, etc...
---- Various barns might be known for having particularly good ones of one of these & might attract people from afar
-- Art supplies, etc.
-- Counselors!!!

- HOW IS IT FUNDED?
-- Everything is based on classes
-- The government has a recommended curriculum and funds teachers for all the classes in that curriculum at every barn
-- Private teachers can offer any class in the barn using the barn's resources
--- subject to certain caveats on appropriateness of the class, maybe?
--- they can set their price at anything from 0 to ???
--- maybe the class would be cancelled if there wasn't enough enrollment?
--- maybe they have to pay to use RB if their class is for-profit? like a percentage?
---- a procedure is needed for allocating resource spaces if there is high demand
-- Using the rec spaces & the resources on your own time (if they're not booked for something) & joining the sports leagues, etc. are free -- funded by taxpayer dollars!
-- If you're low-income the government sends you "education stamps" that are applicable to any course offered thru RB

- COUNSELORS
-- Are great.
-- An intake counselor talks to you when you first come in (if you want) or finds you wandering around
--- These peeps are selected for having great skills at talking to nervous people and identifying interests
--- Society-of-the-tower-like, they try to match people to where their interest will be most engaged
-- Intake counselor can then recommend you to some of the other counseling staff, like athletic counselor, academic counselor, or 

- Counselors, teachers, & staff are hired by some kind of administrative body.
-- Part-time low-level staff jobs available for education stamp credit or for $!
