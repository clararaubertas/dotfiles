Once all steps have been completed, but before approval is requested, the navigation bar disappears. Is this on purpose/why? I think they should be able to modify things until they request approval. \
\
Because we need the borrower agreement to be signed last, and because we need it be the last step, and because we need lenders to be able to modify their request before they submit for approval, we should: let them modify things, but if they do, have them re-sign the borrower agreement. \

[Jose's Bug]: I'm not sure what the exacts steps are for this bug, but we've reproduced it twice.

\b0\fs24 \cf0 Right now, the calculations on amounts due to lenders are being done on the amount *sent* to a borrower. This does not allow us to keep our fixed fee of 2.5%! The question then is, what number should be used for calculations? One solution is "the sum of all payments sent to LendSquare for this loan". Another alternative is for this to be a field admin inputs "actual loan amount" or something. The best answer would be to combine these two, and default an editable number to the sum of all payments sent to LendSquare for this loan, and we can edit it if necessary. Then, when we make a payment to the borrowing business, we will make it for 97.5% of their loan amount and the payments/due/etc will still be calculated on the 100%.\
\
Also, I am getting a wrong calculation for what is due to a Lender (see screenshot 5, same loan as above/below). We should be careful with how things are calculated if/when a number like amount sent is changed. Principal remaining is wrong (should be 1000), and even with numbers shown interest due is wrong.  \
\
Can we have an alert/test for when numbers don't add up. Ie, if amount sent to business != amount transferred by lenders (confirmed) X .095, and similar for amounts due to lenders and from borrowers? Are there any tests already programmed in? If so, what are they? \
\
Variable fee is being calculated wrong, I think. Look at loan "Buying a LetterPress Machine". Here, I see a variable fee due on month 1 of $4.99. Now, my calculations show that this fee should be $1.25. \
Principal Remaining= 1,000\
Max IR = .05\
Actual IR = .02\
Savings Fee % = (.05-.02)/2 = .015\
Savings Fee ($) = .015/12 X 1000 = 1.25 \

For a lender with loans in repayment **and** pledge periods: her dashboard shows only the table "My archived bids". It should show all relevant tables: My archived bids, outstanding loans, payments coming in, etc. For example: this lender cannot see her payment schedule for the loan she currently has in repayment period. We won't be requiring the lender agreement to be signed for every loan, so the dashboard should not change much if a lender has new bids or loans (and we won't require the "you have xx days" band anymore).  \

I thought that loans not currently available for pledging loans would appear in blueish (at least, that was happening before) under active loans in the all loans page (/loans). \
\
When a loan is no longer in pledging period and I go to it, say, by typing in the link, the "make a bid" button is gone (good) but there is nothing there (bad) so the layout breaks and a user wouldn't know that the pledging period is over. I suggest replacing the "make a bid" button with a non-clickable one that says "This campaign is no longer active".\
