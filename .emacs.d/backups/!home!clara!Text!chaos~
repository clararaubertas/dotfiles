* chaos
** a particular nonlinear dynamic wherein seemingly random events are actually predictable from simple deterministic equations.
** can't be linear
** but is deterministic
** but you can't tell that it is!
** two initial configurations differing by a small, possibly imperceptible/immesurable amount:
*** the difference grows *exponentially* with time
*** "sensitivity to initial conditions"
** A common source of such sensitivity to initial conditions is that the map represents a repeated folding and stretching of the space on which it is defined.
*** (??)
** each point in such a system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future trajectories.
*** Sliding Doors
*** Community episode
*** "A Sound of Thunder"
** A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with only a finite amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system will no longer be predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.
* the logistic map
** simple quadratic equation
*** (nonlinear)
** "iterative map"
** describing the change in a system from a fixed point attractor, to a periodic attractor, to chaos as a bifurcation variable increases in value
** see bifurcation diagram on wikipedia
*** self-similar, like fractals
* Lorenz equations
** ???
** butterfly-looking attractor
** butterfly effect (coincidence)
** weather prediction
** example of sensitivity to initial conditions brought on by nearly unnoticeable rounding error
** Lorenz quips: "Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."
** chaotic behavior on an attractor:
*** lots of things are in the basin of attraction so lots of things tend to chaos
* complexity
** "the edge of chaos"
** not non-chaotic determinism
** but not randomness (which is symmetrical, statistically describable)
** fractal structure: visible on any scal
