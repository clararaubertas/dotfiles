Ghost 3: 
- louder piano in initial instrumental break
- transition into "I remember" is weakest sounding part
- slow instrumental break sounds awesome
HOY 2:
- 2nd chorus is fucked up
- before that it sounds album quality
- instrumental break w/ guitar part before quiet verse is good
- organ w/ verse is great!
Jealousy 2:
- messed up drumming on 1st chorus
-
